    "content": "@pmairca the real challenge with buying pump.fun coins is, finding ones that are not bundled.  Because here is the issue -- Recently token dev's are sending liquidity transaction \"bundled\" with their own swaps using JITO bundles. This allows them to package their liquidity transaction together with their swap transactions in a guaranteed sequence. They are sending for example: \\[liquid tx, 1st swap tx, 2nd swap tx\\] in that particular order so theirs swaps are always first after the liquid. Then often they are sending those swapped tokens to multiple wallets \"diluting\" true token hold percentage, so if you check biggest holders you wan't see single wallet holding for example 50% of supply. Then ofc they dump hard the token",
