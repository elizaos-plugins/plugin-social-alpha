    "content": "Reposted from ai16z dev general, applicable to anyone who wants to join our team. We really need senior / leadership oriented devs especially.\n\nThis has rapidly shifted from being my project to being our project. My own contributions are rapidly being outpaced by the hivemind. We are delivering value to teams across the world, and people are showing up to help.\n\nWe are going to announce a major donation tomorrow from someone who is beloved and well trusted in the space. This will be used to set up a dev fund with ~2 months runway. If it goes well, he has promised to double his contribution.\nWe have similar commitments from others.  I can promise a small core dev team 6 months of full time work.\n\nI sent most of you incentive, or you got some of your own, but the problem with that incentive is that if you spend it, it makes the value go down, and it's just way more valuable to hold in the long term that to spend on living.\n\nOur goal is to set up a stable, reliable $ income so that you can come work full time or part time consistently with us and know that on any given day you're not gonna have to worry about the price.\n\nWhat I need to know from each of you, either here or in DMs, is this:\nWhat is your ideal role in the project and more broadly, in life?\nWhat do you really want to be working on?\nHow much money do you need from the org to be unlocked to do your best work?\nAre you interested in a casual contributorship, part time or full time commitment, or something else?\nAre you interested in leadership, project management or a more \"serious\" role in making things happen?\n\nIf there are any other questions or feedback, please let me know.",
