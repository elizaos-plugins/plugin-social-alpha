    "content": "@pmairca can you identify in a coin on pump.fun during your analysis of it, if it has been bundled?\n\nBecause here is the issue -- Recently token dev's are sending liquidity transaction \"bundled\" with their own swaps using JITO bundles. This allows them to package their liquidity transaction together with their swap transactions in a guaranteed sequence. They are sending for example: \\[liquid tx, 1st swap tx, 2nd swap tx\\] in that particular order so theirs swaps are always first after the liquid. Then often they are sending those swapped tokens to multiple wallets \"diluting\" true token hold percentage, so if you check biggest holders you wan't see single wallet holding for example 50% of supply. Then ofc they dump hard the token.\n\nTo check if token was bundled you can go to jito bundle explorer (google it) and paste the liquidity transaction hash in search and you will then see if this was bundled.",
