    "content": "> That is completely normal in this space. Ai16z went from sub 1-2m to 90m(?) inside a week. Let the chart consolidate while their tech is being built out and tested. \n\nThat's something that applies in general situations, but in a major bull market where everything from stocks to coins is rising, who’s going to care if we’re going in the opposite direction? \nRight now, anyone can make money just by buying anything—who’s going to care about Marc V1? People knows it's coming out on Tuesday, but there’s no price reaction, right? That’s proof that interest is already fading. And we’ll have to wait for Marc V1 to actually show results, meaning we’ll have to wait for the coins Marc invested in to rise, right? \nFunds don’t show returns immediately.\n\nAnd you said it's V1, right? Of course, it's not perfect. It’ll need to be upgraded based on feedback, and that will take more time.\n \nI’m not being overly negative. I invested knowing all this, but in a situation like this, where even the basics aren’t being solved, and the founder is getting involved in everything instead of focusing on the problems, doesn’t that frustrate you? On top of that, telling people who are voicing complaints to just sell and leave—how is that any different from what SBF or Do Kwon did?\n\n@shaw \nI really hope DAO takes this situation seriously. Building a community and maintaining interest is hard, but it’s so easy and fast to lose it.",
