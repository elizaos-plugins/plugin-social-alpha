    "content": "Well, examples may differ depending on the person, but I think L2 got mocked because they focused too much on technical talk. \n\nIn the Korean community, many people are concerned about Shaw issuing two coins in a market where it's hard to succeed with even one, while interfering with everything on Twitter. And I believe this concern has been directly reflected in the price. \n\nSituation is quite serious right now because if this continues—other coins are rising, but our coin’s price keeps going the opposite way—the entire community could collapse. DAO needs to take this seriously.",

    "content": "L2s got mocked because the whole ETH ecosystem underperformed for the whole year. It had nothing to do with them focusing more on tech vs other stuff(idek what else a serious project will focus on). \n\n> people are concerned about Shaw issuing two coins in a market where it's hard to succeed with even one\nThis is a very fair concern. But IMO this project's eventual success/failure is dependent on how pmairca's development turns out to be. Nothing else matters. \n\n\n> other coins are rising, but our coin’s price keeps going the opposite way\n\nThat is completely normal in this space. Ai16z went from sub 1-2m to 90m(?) inside a week. Let the chart consolidate while their tech is being built out and tested. \n\n\nAnyway I'm just extremely retarded and stupid so whatever i said is probably retarded and stupid too",
