// NOTE: The content of this file has been commented out as its primary logic
// for calculating agent-specific position performance does not seem to be directly used
// in the core user-focused trust score calculation mechanism of the plugin.
// It might be intended for a different feature (e.g., agent self-trading P&L) or could be legacy code.
// Review and uncomment if this logic is indeed required for the user trust marketplace.
